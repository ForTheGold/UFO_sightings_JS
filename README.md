Data visualization with JavaScript

## Overview

Daina is a data journalist who focuses on data presentation.  She has reached a point in her career where she is able to dive deeper into researching topics of her own choice.  The opportunity has presented itself to focus on her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon.  Daina has jumped on this opportunity for a number of reasons.  The first is that the project presents her with an opportunity to revisit her childhood and the people back home which is something that excites her.  In addition to that, McMinnville is famous for UFOs which is a topic that she finds fun, interesting and mysterious.

### Background

McMinnville is a city in Oregon that is famous for an interesting and unusual topic, UFOs.  The city is famous for UFO sightings and there is even an annual fair of UFO enthusiasts who gather to give talks, share photographs, and hold parades.  Daina has been interested in this topic ever since she was a child and she heard about Farmer Trent’s UFO sighting.  Paul and Evelyn Trent were a farming couple who lived outside of McMinnville and took photographs of a UFO they found flying through the sky.  The UFOs were printed in magazines and newspapers across the nation.

### Purpose

Daina has been given a JavaScript file that is filled with UFO sighting information.  There is all kinds of information in this file including information on countries, states, cities and types of sightings.  Daina is aware of JavaScript’s visual functionality and would like to use the language to display the data in the file in an easily viewable table.  However, there is really a great deal of data in the file which would make it difficult to sift through the data.  JavaScript provides a good way to do this by providing filters.  This will all be put together in a clean HTML page that includes her article and the data as well as a filtering system to make it easy to find any results.

## Results

We have put together a site using Daina’s article and the data that was given to us in the JavaScript file.  I have found a nice image to use at the top followed by Daina’s article which are viewable in the following image.

Below the article, the default is to have the entire table showing on the site.  The table is styled and contains seven columns which include date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments.  The data is shown below that with a form to filter the data shown on the left hand side.

A visitor to the site can use the table to filter the data by filling in any of the fields with valid data.  The table page is dynamic and will change immediately based upon the search results as shown below.

It is also possible to search based upon multiple criteria at a time and the site will update dynamically to display the desired results.

## Summary

This is a website that makes it easy to search for and view UFO sightings.  The website offers a picture at the top with an article.  Below that there is a table of data with information on UFO sightings.  The table of sightings is searchable and updates dynamically based upon search criteria that has been input on the table on the right hand side.

### Improvements

One drawback of this site is that you cannot search the comment section.  My first suggestion would be to add a filter that allows for a keyword search within the comment section.  Another drawback of the site is that it displays all the same information to every user that visits the site.  It would be cool to use location data on the user to order the data by distance from the visitor’s location.

### Recommendations

There are many additional features that could be added to this site.  I would start with allowing users to interact with the site which could be done in a variety of ways.  There should be a way for users to add to the data set.  There could be an input form which allows users to add their own sightings which would then be approved by the owner of the site.  I would also recommend some sort of a forum or comments section where users can discuss their own opinions on the material that is presented on the site.

There are also several other elements that would make the site more complete.  We could add an About and a Contact page for starters so that users would be able to contact the owner of the site.  I believe another addition that would be very beneficial to the user base would be a Resource section that provides recommendations to books and documentaries on the topic as well as links to additional web resources that provide more information on the sightings.
